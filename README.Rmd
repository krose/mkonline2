# mkonline2

This package let's you access the RESTful API from Wattsight. The API is currently in beta and breaking changes might happen.

* MkOnline has changed its name to Wattsight. These changes will be implemented when I get the time.

## Installation

Get a client id and password from [Wattsight](http://auth.wattsight.com/) and save it to the .Renviron file as.

```

WS_CLIENT_ID = <CLIENT ID>
WS_CLIENT_SECRET = <PASSWORD>

```

You can install mkonline2 from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("krose/mkonline2")
```

## Example

Use the examples from the exported functions.

```{r example}
## basic example code
